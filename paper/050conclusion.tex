In this section we will come to a conclusion.

\noindent We have collected a novel dataset of 4.6 million Twitter user profiles based on the users followed by or following users in the \textsc{Cresci-2018} dataset. In our analysis we have found a number of graph features and aggregate features that can help in bot classification. We propose a novel method to bot classification which utilizes neighborhood-based features for classification. Our method performs better than the competitors on the \textsc{Cresci-2018} dataset.
