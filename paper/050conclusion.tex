\noindent We have proposed a novel way of generating aggregate neighborhood features in an unsupervised manner from unlabelled data of nodes adjacent to a user in the network's social graph. Apart from data collection efforts these features are free and lead to more accurate classification results. We conducted experiments on the expanded \textsc{Cresci-2018} dataset. In order to generate the neighborhood features we have collected a novel dataset of 4.6 million Twitter user profiles based on the users followed by or following users in the \textsc{Cresci-2018} dataset. In our analysis of the retrieved data we have found a number of egograph features and aggregate features across user neighborhoods that can help in bot classification. We propose a novel method to bot classification which utilizes neighborhood-based features for classification. Our method performs better than the competitors on the \textsc{Cresci-2018} dataset.
