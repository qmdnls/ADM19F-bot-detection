\item Read more to our approach related work, est. $\sim$2h [Nazarov]
\item Explore the graph data to find possible discrepancies between subgraphs of bots and subgraphs of real users, est. $\sim$6h [Nazarov]
\item Run experiments on the data, est. $\sim$12h [Bebensee, Nazarov]
\item Develop a classification approach based on our findings, est. $\sim$8h [Bebensee, Nazarov]
\item Evaluate our approach in experiments, determine precision, recall, AUC (area under ROC), est. $\sim$10h [Bebensee, Nazarov]
