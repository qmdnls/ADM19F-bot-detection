\subsection{Neighborhood-based classification}
The main motivation behind our method
is to handle spikes carefully.
Since the input signals are noisy, with bursty noise,
traditional methods like time-warping and wavelets
will focus on the spikes, and ignore the rest of the signal,
giving misleading results.

Our proposed method is as follows: 
We will use the spike-detection method of $\ldots$,
to remove spikes, and only then,  we use the $k$ strongest
Daubechies-4 wavelet coefficients, to compare the two (spike-removed)
sound clips.

\noindent
\textit{Logistic regression.} Given a set of $m$ trainings samples $S = \{ (x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) \}_{i=1}^m$ where $x^{(i)}$ responds to the input features and $y^{(i)}$ in $\{ 0,1 \}$ to the labels, we can model logistic regression as
$$
p(y=1|x,\theta) = \frac{1}{1+\text{exp}(-\theta^T x)}
$$
with model parameters $\theta$.
